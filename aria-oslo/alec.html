        The canvas was blank. It shouldn't have been. There should have been art on the canvas, at
        least a stroke if not more. The fact that the art wasn't there was frustrating. Actually, it
        was even more than frustrating. It was downright distressing. She was after the truth. At
        least, that's what she told herself. She believed it, but any rational person on the outside
        could see she was lying to herself. It was apparent she was really only after her own truth
        that she'd already decided and was after this truth because the facts didn't line up with
        the truth she wanted. So she continued to tell everyone she was after the truth oblivious to
        the real truth sitting right in front of her.

        The red line moved across the page. With each millimeter it advanced forward, something
        changed in the room. The actual change taking place was difficult to perceive, but the
        change was real. The red line continued relentlessly across the page and the room would
        never be the same.

        She considered the birds to be her friends. She'd put out food for them each morning and
        then she'd watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day. She wondered
        what they would do if something ever happened to her. Would they miss the meals she provided
        if she failed to put out the food one morning?

        She sat down with her camera in her hand, her mind wandering to faraway places. She paused
        and considered all that had happened. It hadn't gone as expected. When the day began she
        thought it was going to be a bad one, but as she sat recalling the day's events, she had to
        admit, it had been a rather marvelous day. Welcome to my world. You will be greeted by the
        unexpected here and your mind will be challenged and expanded in ways that you never thought
        possible. That is if you are able to survive...She counted. One. She could hear the steps 
        coming closer. Two. Puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth. Three. He stopped 
        beside her. Four. She pulled the trigger of the gun.

        Rhonda prided herself on always taking the path less traveled. She'd decided to do this at
        an early age and had continued to do so throughout her entire life. It was a point of pride
        and she would explain to anyone who would listen that doing so was something that she'd made
        great efforts to always do. She'd never questioned this decision until her five-year-old
        niece asked her, "So, is this why your life has been so difficult?" and Rhonda didn't have
        an answer for her. "What is the best way to get what you want?" she asked. He looked down at
        the ground knowing that she wouldn't like his answer. He hesitated, knowing that the truth
        would only hurt. How was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he
        wanted was to leave her?
